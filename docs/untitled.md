[Seam](https://www.seam.so) is a social network that allows users to build and sell open-source miniapps. It provides a platform for online creatives to showcase their work, curate inspiration, and collaborate with peers.

We've made it easy in this repository to make a new miniapp, and then publish it live so that anyone else in the world can use your new creation, too. We're all building this together!

The fastest way to make a miniapp is to [open our sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/seam-xyz/Miniapp-Builder/main) and run our creation script:
```bash
./seam-magic.sh
```
The full documentation lives at [docs.getseam.xyz](https://docs.getseam.xyz/miniapp-creation/rendering-a-miniapp).

#### What are miniapps?

The core piece of sharing on Seam is the **miniapp**. Miniapps are tiny playgrounds, allowing you to create content. When youâ€™re done, you make a post. For example, the Pixel Art miniapp allows you to become a pixel artist, and then share the final masterpiece as a post.

**What happens when you make a miniapp on Seam?**

* Accepted miniapps are live on seam.so and the Seam iOS app. You'll have your code in the appstore!
* Anyone else on Seam can use your miniapp to make posts.
  * Eventually, you'll be able to earn Seam Points when other users unlock your miniapp.
* You'll learn to code Javascript and React, one of the most used languages on the Internet.
