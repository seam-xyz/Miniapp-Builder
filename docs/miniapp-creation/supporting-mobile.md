# Supporting Mobile

All miniapps on Seam run on all devices, both phones and on web on desktop computers. Therefore, as a miniapp developer, you'll need to make sure that you're happy with how your miniapp works on both large devices and small devices. By default, the miniapp testing harness that you've been using so far as been the desktop composer -- but there is an easy way to change the dimensions to make sure your miniapp works for phones, too.

### Testing on Mobile

The best way to test for mobile screen sizes is by using the dev tools built into your web browser. For example, in Chrome, you'll want to use [Device Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode).
