## Create apps & games for a gen-z social network!

[Seam](https://www.seam.so) is a social network that allows users to build and sell open-source miniapps. It provides a platform for online creatives to showcase their work, curate inspiration, and collaborate with peers.

Accepted miniapps are live on [seam.so](https://www.seam.so) and the [Seam iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seam-social/id6473547569). You'll have your code in the appstore!

#### **Why develop a miniapp as your personal project?**

* **Quick Development:** Build your project in an hour or less, without the hassle of hosting frameworks.&#x20;
* **Remix Open Source Code:** Learn from and customize existing miniapps.&#x20;
* **Free Databases:** Seam takes care of all your data storage needs.&#x20;
* **Find Users:** Go live to everyone on Seam.&#x20;
* **Earn Rewards:** Get paid in Seam Points each time your miniapp is unlocked.&#x20;
* **Join a Growing Ecosystem:** Be an early adopter to the future of social networks.

## What are miniapps?

The core piece of sharing on Seam is the **miniapp**. Miniapps are tiny playgrounds, allowing you to create content. When you’re done, you make a post. For example, the Pixel Art miniapp allows you to become a pixel artist, and then share the final masterpiece as a post.

Miniapps are React components coded in Typescript, styled with Tailwind. This means that you can use all the existing React code on the internet to get started creating your miniapp — as a bonus, ChatGPT and other AI assistants are really good at writing React code :)
